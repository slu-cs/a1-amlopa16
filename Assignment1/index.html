              The Board is responsible for the implementation of State Election Law
            and the administration of elections in St. Lawrence County.  In doing so,
            they are entrusted to ensure that each qualified voter has the opportunity

              St. Lawrence County maintains voter registration data for approximately
            60,000 active voters.  For election purposes, the County's 32 Towns and
            City of Ogdensburg are further divided into "election districts."  These
            election districts are determined by each municipality, based on its
            number of registered voters.  Currently, there are a total of 81 election
            districts throughout the county.

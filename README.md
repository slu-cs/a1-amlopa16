Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I can't find who works at the BoE or how to email the BoE.
    - The Voter Registration application form is mentioned, but not linked.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the deadlines for registration in 2020.
    - I can only find early voting dates for 2 of the 3 elections in 2020.
    - I can't find any deadlines for absentee voting.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - A couple of questionable tag choices (see index.html).
    - Some content outside the body of a page (see register.html).
    - Election dates & deadlines would be nice to present in a table.
    - The Voting Registration and Voting Information pages are a little lengthy and could use a bit more internal structure.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The Voting Registration page doesn't have the margins that the other pages do.
    - The Voting Information page uses no less than four different formats for lists.
